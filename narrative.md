Language of Proteins

Our machine learning project is driven by recent breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing and transformer models that have paved the way for new types of deep language models. One of the most promising applications of these models is in the biological domain, where development of general-purpose protein language models that can predict specific protein types could pave the way to more effective, safer cancer treatments.

To achieve this goal, we aim to develop a deep language model capable of predicting specific protein types by leveraging existing pre-trained models on large protein datasets. We will also explore classical approaches such as hand-engineered representations based on biological, statistical, and chemical properties of the peptides. Our model will be assessed on three small datasets containing amino acid sequences with labeled pairs of inputs and outputs provided as .csv files. Additionally, pre-computed hand-engineered features selected by bio-experts will also be available upon request.

Our primary accuracy metric is classification accuracy, which measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model. This metric is directly connected to the KPIs named above, as the success of the project is dependent on the accuracy of the model in predicting specific protein types. We believe that the potential business value hypothesis of AI-inspired protein-sequencing breakthroughs like this is significant in the long term, particularly in the biotechnology industry. Our project has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach cancer treatments, creating more effective and personalized treatment options for cancer patients.

In conclusion, our machine learning project is focused on developing a deep language model that can predict specific protein types, with potential business value in the biotechnology industry. By leveraging existing pre-trained models and classical approaches, we will assess the model's performance and contribute to the development of more effective and personalized cancer treatments. Our work has the potential to transform the way we understand and treat cancer, ultimately improving the lives of millions of people worldwide.
